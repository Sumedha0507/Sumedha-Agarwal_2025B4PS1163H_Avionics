# Arduino LED Circuit Simulation on Tinkercad
This project demonstrates how to design and simulate a simple LED circuit using Arduino Uno, resistors, and LEDs on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  
The primary goal of this project was to understand how to connect different components of a circuit and simulate their functionality in a virtual environment before implementing them physically.
My takeaways 
- Learnt how to create a basic circuit using Arduino Uno.  
- Explore the role of resistors in controlling current flow.  
- Simulate the blinking and glowing of LEDs using Arduino code.  
- Understand the importance of correct pin connections and circuit design.  
- Practice building circuits in Tinkercad’s online simulator
- Learnt the functioning of the force sensor 
# Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3 – Microcontroller to control the circuit.  
- Resistors (200Ω and 1kΩ) – To limit current and protect the LEDs.  
- LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)– To visualize the output.  
- Jumper Wires – For making connections.

Setup and Connections
1. Arduino → Breadboard:Connect Arduino pins to the breadboard for easy component placement.  
2. Resistor → LED:Each LED should be connected in series with a resistor to avoid burning out.  
3. Digital Pin → LED Anode (+):The positive terminal of the LED goes to a digital output pin on Arduino (e.g., pin 13).  
4. LED Cathode (-) → Ground (GND):The negative terminal connects to GND.
5. Buzzer
6. Repeat steps for multiple LEDs if required.
